            <h1>Cantus Database</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                Cantus is a database of the Latin chants found in over 130 manuscripts and early printed books.
            </p>
            <p>
                This searchable digital archive holds inventories of primarily antiphoners and breviaries
                from medieval Europe; these are the main sources for the music sung in the liturgical Office.
                You are currently accessing the Cantus Database through a secondary user interface called
                <i>Vitrail</i>.
