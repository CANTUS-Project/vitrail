The word *vitrail* in French means "stained glass." The easiest way an outsider can see into a
monastery or abbey is by looking in the windows.

How To: Develop
---------------

Just do it!

How To: Deploy
--------------

Install "babel" with NPM, and use it to compile ``vitrail.js.`` Then load the compiled file in
``index.html`` instead of ``JSXTransformer`` and ``vitrail.js``.

Also change the root URL in the script while you're at it.

I'll write a script for this.
